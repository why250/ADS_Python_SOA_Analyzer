# ADS 2025 SOA Analysis GUI User Manual

**Version:** V1.0
**Environment:** ADS 2025 (Linux CentOS 7 / Windows)
**Date:** February 5, 2026

---

## 1. Introduction

The **SOA Analysis GUI** is a Python-based extension tool integrated into Keysight ADS 2025. It is designed to help circuit design engineers quickly verify the Safe Operating Area (SOA) of components. The tool directly reads simulation Datasets (`.ds`) generated by ADS, combines them with user-defined JSON rule files, and automatically analyzes voltage, current, power, and temperature stresses on devices (such as BJTs and Resistors). It provides comprehensive visualization of waveforms and violation reports.

## 2. Installation and Loading

Before using the tool for the first time, you must load the add-on into the ADS environment.

1. Launch **ADS 2025**.
2. In the main window menu, go to **Tools** -> **App Manager**.
3. Click **Add User Addon...** in the pop-up window.
4. Browse and select the `matlablink_addon.ael` file, then click **Open** to load it.
   * *Note: Upon successful loading, a "MatlabLink" menu will appear in the main window menu bar.*

## 3. Pre-Simulation Setup (Critical)

To ensure the GUI can access all necessary data for analysis, specific settings must be configured in the Schematic.

### 3.1 Enable All-Node Data Saving

1. Open the **Testbench Schematic** you intend to simulate.
2. Add or edit the **Options** component.
3. Switch to the **Output** tab and locate the **Output filters** section.
4. **You MUST check** the following two options:

   * [X] **Save branch currents**
   * [X] **Save internal node voltages**

   * *Reason: Default settings often skip saving currents for all device pins, which will cause the SOA analysis to fail.*

### 3.2 Prepare the SOA Rule File

1. Copy the pre-defined rule file `soa_limits_ex.json` to the **Workspace** directory of your current project.
2. The GUI defaults to looking for this file upon startup. If you use a different filename, you can load it manually via the GUI interface.

## 4. Launching the Tool

1. In the Schematic window, click on the menu **MatlabLink** -> **SOA Analysis**.
2. Wait for a moment, and the **ADS Simulation Data SOA Analyzer** graphical interface will appear.

---

## 5. Operation Workflow

The tool supports both "One-Click Automation" and "Step-by-Step" operation modes.

### Interface Overview

* **Top-Left (Control Panel):** Displays the current Workspace and Design paths; contains main operation buttons.
* **Bottom-Left (Device Tree):** Lists all analyzed devices and their status (PASS/FAIL).
* **Right Side (Visualization):** Display area for SOA curves, time-domain waveforms, and result tables.

### Operation Steps

#### Mode A: One-Click Run (Recommended)

1. Click the **"Run Simulation"** button in the GUI.
   * The program will automatically execute the sequence: Run ADS Simulation -> Generate Dataset -> Convert to DataFrame -> Load JSON Rules -> Perform Analysis.
   * Once completed, the interface results will refresh automatically.

#### Mode B: Step-by-Step (For debugging or loading historical data)

If you do not wish to re-run the simulation, follow this order:

1. **Convert .ds to Dataframe**: Select an existing `.ds` file to convert it to CSV format and load it into memory.
2. **Load CSV Data** (Optional): Directly load previously converted CSV data.
3. **Load Limit Config (JSON)**: Select the SOA limit rule file (Defaults to `soa_limits_ex.json` in the workspace).
4. **Analyze**: Execute the SOA rule check algorithm to update the device tree and charts.

## 6. Results and Analysis

### 6.1 Viewing Device Status (Device Tree)

After analysis, the left panel lists all detected devices:

* **Resistors / BJTs**: Grouped by device type.
* **Status Indicators**:
  * **FAIL**: The device exceeded SOA limits at some point during the simulation time (Highlighted in the list).
  * **OK**: The device remained within the safe operating area.
* **Interaction**: Click on a specific device in the list (e.g., `X1.Q1`) to update the charts on the right.

### 6.2 Data Visualization (Right Tabs)

* **BJT SOA / Resistor SOA**: Displays V-I trajectory plots or power curves to visually assess if the trajectory crosses safe boundaries.
* **V (Time) / I (Time) / P (Time) / T (Time)**:
  * Displays Voltage, Current, Power, and Temperature waveforms over time.
  * **Dashed Line**: Represents the Limit (e.g., `Temp limit: 125.0°C`).
  * **Solid Line**: Represents the actual simulation waveform.
  * *Usage: Quickly identify the exact timestamp where a violation occurred.*

### 6.3 Detailed Violation Report (Result Table)

Click the **Result Table** tab to view the detailed data grid:

* **Columns**: Device Name, Time (Violation timestamp), Parameter (Type: IE/VCE/P, etc.), Value (Measured), Limit, Violation Type.
* **Export Report**: Click the **"Export Violations as CSV"** button at the bottom to save all violation records as a CSV file for reporting purposes.

## 7. FAQ

* **Q: The device list on the left is empty after clicking Analyze.**
  * A: Please check the Schematic **Options** component and ensure **"Save branch currents"** is checked.
* **Q: Error "File not found" regarding the JSON file.**
  * A: Ensure `soa_limits_ex.json` is located in the root of your current Workspace, or use the "Load Limit Config" button to select the file manually.
